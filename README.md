# StockAuto
 This is a automated stock market trading bot created with python and Creon API.

**Environment**

python 3.8.2 32bit.

Used Conda virtual 32 bit env. (Must use 32 bit as CREON API only supports 32 bit env).

**How to use it**

To use it, you must install all dependancies on the .py files. 

Then, create a CREON bank account and install the desktop software. Also, install slack and create account, and a channel to deploy this bot.

The token of the bot must be put in to the test.py file prior to the use to test if the API calls can be made correctly. 

Use Windows scheduler or similar software to schedule the automated trading.
